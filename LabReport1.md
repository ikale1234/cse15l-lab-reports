# How to Log onto ieng6 Account
## By Ishaan Kale

First, install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) on whatever platform you are on. Once installed, it
should be easy to access the directories within your computer and write code.
It also has a built-in terminal which we will be using to remote connect.
(terminal can be opened using control ` on mac)

Then, click [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and then follow the
instructions to find the account username and reset your password. Once the password is
reset, wait a little while, and then type in ```ssh cs15lwi23**@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` into the
VScode terminal where ```**``` is the last 3 digits of your username found at the website
shown above. Follow the instructions on the terminal, and you will end up remotely
logging in! It should look like this:

Using this remote connection, you can traverse and alter the directory system of the
computer you are connected to. Using cd, ls, mkdir, etcâ€¦ play around with commands and
see what you can do to the given directory.
