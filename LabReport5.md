## Bash script to hasten Lab Report 4

For lab report 4, there were certain keystrokes/shortcuts that could speed up the process of the commands.
However, if the process was needed to be repeated, a great way to make the process significantly faster is 
by using a bash script. I made a bash script for this purpose and put it in a github repo. After logging into
ieng6, I can clone this repo, enter the respective folder, and run the first bash script.


This first bash script (bash1.sh) does steps 5-6, which would normally take 4 commands in the terminal is now
simplified into one short one. It ends with the failing tests, and the fixes to the file are now needed.

Step 7 is best done outside of the bash script, as it requires manual editing.


After fixing the file the 2nd bash script will run the tests again and process the github pushing commands.
This condenses 6 lines of code into one.
