## Bash script to hasten Lab Report 4

For lab report 4, there were certain keystrokes/shortcuts that could speed up the process of the commands.
However, if the process was needed to be repeated, a great way to make the process significantly faster is 
by using a bash script. I made a bash script for this purpose and put it in a github repo. After logging into
ieng6, I can clone this repo, enter the respective folder, and run the first bash script.


This first bash script (bash1.sh) does steps 5-6, which would normally take 4 commands in the terminal is now
simplified into one short one. 

Step 7 is best done outside of the bash script, as it requires manual editing.
